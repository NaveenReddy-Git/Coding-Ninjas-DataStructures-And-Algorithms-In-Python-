# Coding-Ninjas---Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-using-Python
Solved problems and assignments of DSA course taught by Coding Ninjas team

This repository includes all the practice problems and assignments which I've solved during the Data Structures and Algorithms course in Python Programming taught by Coding Ninjas team.


To visualize data structures use this [VisuAlgo](https://visualgo.net/en)



__Download Jupyter notebook from here:__ https://jupyter.org/  
__Installing Jupyter notebook:__ https://jupyter.org/install  
If you're not comfortable with Jupyter notebooks then you can use __Repl.it (Online Editor):__ https://repl.it/languages/python3


__Note:__ Refer serial wise to avoid confusion and non-understanding of topics.

After this course completion, I recommend to have a look on these MIT lectures to get in depth knowledge of data structures and algorithms: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61Oq3tWYp6V_F-5jb5L2iHb
